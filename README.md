[React Financial Charts](https://github.com/reactivemarkets/react-financial-charts) seems a fine piece of engineering but can daunt newcomers who want to include it in their own project.  This shows how.

Forked from [this excellent codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-financial-charts-demo-c88wz).  Built, for better or worse, with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run in dev mode:

```
npm install
npm start
```
